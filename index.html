                   The First date between Haikal and Jidah,
                    It was really awkward at first but at the end of the day it was cool and chill,
                    we get to know each other and became really comfortable with one another.
                    It was one of the most important event in my life,
                    because I never thought someone would ever go on a date with me.
                    We went to the cinema to watch Batman.
