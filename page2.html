                   The Tenth date between Haikal and Jidah, it was a very special and a nerve-wracking day
                   for Jidah because She has to meet my parents! but it all went just fine. We then went to IOI city Mall
                   so that Jidah could buy her essentials for her departure to Perak,
                   after that we had bingsu and lastly we had an
                   impromptu cinema date where we watched the new Dr Strange movie.
